Usage Outside of Create React App

If you want to use this Babel preset in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.

install Babel.

Then install babel-preset-react-app.

`npm install babel-preset-react-app --save-dev`
Then create a file named .babelrc with following contents in the root folder of your project:

{
  "presets": ["react-app"]
}
This preset uses the useBuiltIns option with transform-object-rest-spread and transform-react-jsx, which assumes that Object.assign is available or polyfilled.
